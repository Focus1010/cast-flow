- Ready to paste into your CSS
```

## 🛠️ **Alternative Approaches (If Figma Feels Overwhelming)**

### **Option 1: Request Code-First Delivery**
Ask AI UX Builder to provide:
- **React component code** instead of Figma files
- **CSS stylesheets** with exact styling
- **SVG icon components** ready to use
- **Documentation** with implementation guide

### **Option 2: Use Design-to-Code Tools**
- **Figma to React**: Plugins that convert designs to code
- **Anima**: Exports Figma designs as React components
- **Locofy**: AI-powered design-to-code conversion

### **Option 3: Request Multiple Formats**
Ask for:
- **Figma files** (for future reference)
- **PNG mockups** (for visual reference)
- **CSS code** (for immediate implementation)
- **SVG icons** (as individual files)

## 📋 **What to Ask AI UX Builder For**

### **Beginner-Friendly Request**:
```
"Please provide the Cast Flow designs in these formats:

1. Figma file (shareable link)
2. PNG exports of all 7 pages (375px width, 2x resolution)
3. CSS code for all components (copy-paste ready)
4. SVG icons as individual files
5. Design tokens as JSON file
6. Step-by-step implementation guide

I'm new to Figma, so please include instructions on how to:
- Navigate the Figma file
- Export additional assets if needed
- Get CSS properties from designs
- Understand the component structure"
```

### **Code-Focused Request**:
```
"I prefer code over design files. Please provide:

1. React JSX components for all UI elements
2. CSS/SCSS stylesheets with exact styling
3. SVG React components for all icons
4. JSON file with design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts)
5. Implementation checklist
6. Mobile-responsive CSS media queries

Format everything as copy-paste ready code that works with Next.js and Tailwind CSS."
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach for You**

Since you're new to Figma, I recommend:

### **Phase 1: Get Both Figma + Code**
- Request Figma files for visual reference
- Request CSS code for immediate implementation
- Request SVG icons as individual files

### **Phase 2: Learn Figma Basics**
- Explore the provided Figma file
- Practice exporting assets
- Learn to inspect elements for CSS

### **Phase 3: Future Design Updates**
- Use Figma for future design iterations
- Make small tweaks and export updates
- Collaborate with designers if needed

## 🚀 **Quick Figma Tutorial for Your Needs**

### **Essential Figma Skills (5 minutes)**:
1. **Navigate**: Click and drag to move around
2. **Select**: Click on any element to select it
3. **Inspect**: Right-click → "Inspect" to see CSS
4. **Export**: Select element → Export panel → Choose format
5. **Measure**: Select two elements to see spacing between them

### **What You Don't Need to Learn**:
- Creating designs from scratch
- Advanced prototyping
- Complex animations
- Team collaboration features

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **For Implementation**:
- Focus on getting **CSS code** first (fastest to implement)
- Use **PNG mockups** as visual reference while coding
- Export **SVG icons** individually for React components
- Save **Figma file** for future reference and updates

### **For Figma Navigation**:
- Use **zoom to fit** (Shift + 1) to see full page
- **Click on layers panel** to find specific elements
- **Use inspect panel** (right side) to get exact measurements
- **Export panel** (bottom right) for downloading assets

The key is getting designs that are **immediately usable** with your existing Cast Flow codebase, whether that's through Figma exports or direct code delivery! 🎨✨
